# Use Markdown Any Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

As this is an open source project we should cover decisions with major impact in a useful way in order to stimulate alignment with other developers and cover the various decisions over the years.

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 3.0.0 – The Markdown Any Decision Records
* One big design document
* Unstructured files covering the design and decisions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 3.0.0", because it comes out best (see below).
* Already a standard for documenting decisions
* Most developers know markdown, or can learn it easily if they don't
* Small, focussed files allow developers to quickly find specific decisions
* The small text files allow easy comparison and reviews
* Having the files in git allows readers to view when decisions were made (or revised)
